   KCPR is a stereo FM radio station broadcasting throughout the Central
        Coast of California on 91.3 MHz. It is the college station of Cal Poly,
            in San Luis Obispo. We broadcast 24/7 online and on air. We play
            music along with a few news and talk shows.

   The station is run by volunteer college students and community members.
   We all do it from our love of music, our community, and the radio.

   We don't get much money from the university, so we ask community members
   and listeners to donate. We'd like it if you did so we can keep broastcasting.
   Every year we have a Pledge Drive, where you can bid on packages of neat items.
   The money we make goes towards buying new equipment and music.

            We have been broadcasting since 1968.
