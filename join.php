<h1>The Process</h1>
<p>Applications are read periodically, followed by an interview.</p>
<p>
Accepted interns are required to attend classes from 6:10-7pm on Wednesday for the six weeks following acceptance. The classes are fun, and teach you skills on how to be a KCPR DJ. In addition to the classes, interns will perform service hours, attend events, and have access to many of the perks KCPR DJ's enjoy! Upon completion of these classes and tasks, interns can choose to begin DJ training, or continue on in a volunteer capacity.
</p>

<h1>Get in Touch</h1>
<p>
Any questions can be directed to the air staff instructors at their open office hours (posted outside the station door), or via email at kcpr91.3.asi@gmail.com.
