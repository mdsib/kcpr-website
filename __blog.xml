      <text>Welcome to Pledge Week 2013! 

      We only have pledge week once a year and
      need your help to keep the station going. We appreciate all the
      support and love you all have given and want to keep providing you
      with quality broadcasting, so we are asking for donations.
      
      This year, we're
      trying to raise money for general maintenence and a remote
      broadcasting system for live shows, interviews, and stuff.
      
      Donate and you will get KCPR gear, personalized love messages,
      mix CDs, or a tour of our station and guest spot on a show of
      your choice! Thanks, from the DJs at KCPR, for keeping us going.
      
      
      Keep radio, music, Cal Poly, the WORLD, and everything else RAMPED!
